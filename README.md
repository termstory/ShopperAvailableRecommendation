# ShopperAvailableRecommendation
You may need it, especially if you think going to the shopping mart without finding what you want is wasting time

## Inspiration
This idea started when we (my wife and I) shopped to a place only to find the fact that some of the things we really needed were out of stock. And that place is miles away from our home. We looked for it to that place because all the shops around us had run out of these items. Of course it was very disappointing for us who have been struggling and throwing away a lot of time. I'm sure many have experienced this problem. I then thought about the possibility of utilizing information technology which was assisted by machine learning as a means to resolve the issue. So, here it is, the prototype for that idea.

## What it does
With the service "Visual Shelf Monitoring" to check the availability of goods and with the service "Personalize" to provide recommendations for other items if the item you are looking for does not exist

## How I built it
By studying the references provided, try them locally and test them online on AWS services

## Challenges I ran into
Choose the service and approach that is most appropriate

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I finally succeeded in completing this prototype even though there are still features that I have planned not finished in time

## What I learned
I finally understood how AWS cloud works and that means a lot to me

## What's next for ShopperAvailableRecommendation
The establishment of ways of working for the user of this program is mainly in synchronizing the real situation with the data available to the user's client
